This Project has 2 parts!

1. First is used to see how will randomForest and base linear regression behave and accuarcy of the same.

2.(Work in progress)
   The second part is intended to use two or more data sheets (depending on how many i can find in their database) that are mainly focused on dates (time scale).
   The idea is to use the Fourier Transform to convert bookings on certain dates into frequency components and feed that data into a model for prediction(part of thrill is to find model that will do that good enough).
   The results i hope to achieve are similar to constructive and destructive interference, but this time instead of a physical phenomenon i aim to model revenue generation behaving like waves. After all those are just numbers!
